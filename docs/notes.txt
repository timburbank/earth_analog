Nicer colors, but would have to remove guard <https://www.ebay.com/itm/Heavy-Duty-Foot-Switch-Pedal-All-Aluminum-Cast-With-Guard-Industrial-Switch-L2/171823247299>

The normal kind <https://www.ebay.com/itm/DPDT-guitar-effects-pedal-footswitch-true-bypass-mod/162782505640>

Emergency stop button <https://www.ebay.com/itm/Emergency-Stop-660V-10A-Red-Sign-Push-Button-Switch-US-Stock/162833990572>


## Lights

Big LED (10mm) <https://www.adafruit.com/product/847>

Pixie 3w RGB LEDs <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2741> Might be awkward form factor but doesn't need a lot of data outputs

8mm LED holders <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2173> (don't think I want them this recessed)

8mm diffuse NeoPixels <https://www.adafruit.com/product/1734>

10mm analog RGB LED <https://www.adafruit.com/product/848> Nice option but I don't thiiiiink I have 3x4 analog outs (nope!)

10mm super bright <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11119> This is the brightest single color I can find


## Microcontrollers

Plain Feather <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2771>

BlueTooth Feather <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2829>

I don't think there's real need for wireless.....there's so much shit plugged in anyways and foot pedals don't need to go far. If it's taking clock sync, accurate timing would be good
.....I'm gonna do it anyways

Alternative to proto board for connecting feather <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2926>

## Working Notes

Big LED end goes to + 

Cords going to volume pedal: Shaft is ground (always connected), tip is power (resistance changes).

Splitter: Shaft of stereo plug connects to both connecting wires. Tip of connecting wires goes to tip and ring

Stereo plug: site pins go to ring and tip. They go to power and GPIO. Center pad is shaft which goes to ground

arien doesn't have Bluetooth LE support, which means no Bluetooth MIDI :(

Volume pedal response is not linear, but I don’t think it’s a proper log either. Seems to start slow then switch to quicker at a specific point
